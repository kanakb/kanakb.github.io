My name is Kanak. I'm a recent grad from Stanford and UCLA, and now I work at LinkedIn on a number of problems, including making [Apache Helix](http://helix.incubator.apache.org) everyone's favorite cluster manager.

I've been writing a lot of Java code lately:

{% highlight java %}
public void onBecomeOnlineFromOffline(Message message, NotificationContext context) {
    celebrate();
}
{% endhighlight %}

but I've worked on things [all over the place](http://linkedin.com/in/kanakbiscuitwala).
